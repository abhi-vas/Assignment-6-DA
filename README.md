##### ðŸ§¾ Summary

This project introduced missing values in the **`AGE`** and **`BILL_AMT1`** columns to evaluate various missing data handling techniques.  
Four datasets were prepared using **Median Imputation, Linear Regression, KNN (Non-Linear) Regression,** and **Listwise Deletion**, followed by training a **Logistic Regression** classifier on each.  
While Listwise Deletion achieved the highest accuracy (0.808), it lost valuable data and reduced generalization.  
**KNN Imputation** produced the best overall balance (Accuracy = 0.803, Macro F1 = 0.70), effectively preserving non-linear feature relationships.  
Hence, **Non-Linear (KNN) Regression Imputation** was identified as the most robust and conceptually sound approach for handling missing data.
